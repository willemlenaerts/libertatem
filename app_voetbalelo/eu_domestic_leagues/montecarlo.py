# What does this file do?
#########################

# This file simulates outcomes for the Jupiler Pro League based on the SPI algorithm and the ELO algorithm
# It uses the a Monte Carlo Simulation

# Python 3.3 as Interpreter

######################
# What does it return?
######################
# A list of 2 things:
# [0]:  List of 2 things
#       [0][0]: Team names of all teams in Jupiler Pro League
#       [0][1]: Array of size (number of teams x 3)
#               [0][1][:,0]: SPI
#               [0][1][:,1]: Off Rating
#               [0][1][:,2]: Def Rating
# Or, in case of ELO simulation:
#       [0][1]: Array of size (number of teams x 1)
#               [0][1][:,0]: ELO

# [1]:  A size (number_of_teams x number_of_teams) matrix with the percentage chance of every team to end up in every
#       possible league position
